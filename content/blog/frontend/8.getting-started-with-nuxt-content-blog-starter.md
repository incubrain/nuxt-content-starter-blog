## The Stack

I'm a fan of simplicity, only what's required is included:

- [nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) - Vue.js framework
- [nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) - Static site generator
- [nuxt/ui]() - Component library that comes bundled with TailwindCSS and 100k available icons, I've added `@iconify-json/mdi`.
- [nuxtjs/seo]() - Super simple SEO for Nuxt
- [nuxt/image]() - 
- []() - 
- []() - 
- []() - 


I've made this starter as simple to understand as possible. 

It's a great way to get started with Nuxt and Nuxt Content.
