This is still a work in progress, I have ambitions to extract this into it's own module, but for now it's part of the blog starter.

## Inline Images

Embedding `internal` or `external` images directly into your Markdown content enhances the visual appeal and context of your blog posts. Here's an example of how to embed an image using custom Markdown components in Nuxt Content:

```md
::inline-image
---
images: 
  - src: nuxt-back-to-the-future.jpg || https://via.placeholder.com/150
    alt: Nuxt Custom Markdown Components
    // add multiple images to create a carousel
  - src: nuxt-back-to-the-future.jpg || https://via.placeholder.com/150
    alt: Nuxt Custom Markdown Components
caption: This is a caption for the image testing to see how it shows up
---
::
```

## Single Inline Image

::inline-image
---
images:
  - src: nuxt-back-to-the-future.jpg
    alt: Nuxt Custom Markdown Components
caption: This is a caption for the image testing to see how it shows up
---

### Carousel Image Embed

Embedding a `carousel` of images directly into your Markdown content enhances the visual appeal and context of your blog posts. Here's an example of how to embed a carousel of images using custom Markdown components in Nuxt Content:

::inline-image
---
images:
  - src: nuxt-back-to-the-future.jpg
    alt: Nuxt Custom Markdown Components
  - src: https://picsum.photos/1920/1080?random=1

### Inline Video Embeds

handling html video embeds in markdown can be a bit tricky. We've made it as simple as possible, all you need is the `path` to the video and the `caption` you want to display. The component will handle the rest.


### Browser Support for Video Formats

It's worth noting that browser support for video formats varies. Here's a handy table to help you decide which formats to use, a good rule of thumb is to use `MP4` if available. `WebM` is a good fallback.

headings: 
  - Browser
  - MP4
  - WebM
  - OGG
rows:
  - browser: Chrome
    mp4: 'YES'
    webm: 'YES'
    ogg: 'PARTIAL'
  - browser: Firefox
    mp4: 'YES'
    webm: 'YES'
    ogg: 'YES'
  - browser: Safari
    mp4: 'YES'
    webm: 'LIMITED'
    ogg: 'LIMITED'
  - browser: Opera
    mp4: 'YES'
    webm: 'YES'
    ogg: 'YES'
