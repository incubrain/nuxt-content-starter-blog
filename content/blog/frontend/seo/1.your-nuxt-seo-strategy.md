## What is the Goal?

This guide aims to get you started on your on-page SEO journey. We will cover the basics of SEO, and
how to get started with each point.

**Only focus on critical fixes otherwise you'll get stuck over-optimising**

### SEO Setup

#### Audit Your Perfomance Today

There's lots of options when it comes to measuring your site performance, as always we reccomend
simplicity and free to start. We use
[Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), because Google is still the
primary search engine and they're telling you exactly what you need to do to improve your google
ranking.

#### Start Tracking Analytics

Fixing SEO issues is important, but if you cannot measure your efforts you're acting bling. Make
sure to setup analytics and review them at minimum once per month. At Incubrain we use
[Posthog](https://posthog.com/), it's free to get started and open-source so you can self-host if
wanted.

#### Robots.txt

Make Sure to add a website robots.txt file, this can be automated with a nuxt plugin.

#### Submit Your Sitemap

- [Google Search Console]() is required to get your website indexed by google.
- [Bing Webmasters Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/about) is required to get your website
  indexed by Bing. **Don't ignore Bing**, with the advent of ChatGPT (Microsoft is their primary
  investor) Bing is making a comeback.

### Improve Your SEO

Google Lighthouse provides 4 performance headings that all impact how they will rank your website.

- **Performance:** Pagespeed will directly impact your bounce rate, every visitor who bounces is a
  potential customer lost.
- **Accessibility:** This is primarily for users with disabilities, but also helps with SEO.
- **Best Practices:**
- **SEO:**

Despite there being a dedicated SEO heading, improving all of them will greatly benefit your SEO.
Complete 5-10 audits for each page per device, this will give you a base line to improve upon.

Next select 5-10 of the most important things to fix NOW from each heading and get to work.
Lighthouse ranks each issue by severity, so start with the most severe.

#### Set Your Targets

### Next Steps

#### Make sure new changes are SEO friendly

You can automate this by setting up a pipeline that runs your website through Lighthouse checks with
every push to your main branch. This will ensure you don't introduce any regressions.

#### Get another opinion

Once you have completed the critical fixes, and after you've focussed on building traffic to your
website, it's time to get further insights into what you can improve. Take your most up to date
audit from your chosen tool, then select another tool to compare against.

- [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
- [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)
- [SEO Mator](https://seomator.com/free-seo-audit-tool)
- [Web Page Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

Compare the insights from each tool, and select ~10 of the most important things to fix NOW.

**Depending on your resources, repeat this step every ~3-6 months to see continuous improvement**

#### Dive Deeper

Look into all of the Lighthouse headings individually, there are specific tools such as
[Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) that will help with **Accessability**.
