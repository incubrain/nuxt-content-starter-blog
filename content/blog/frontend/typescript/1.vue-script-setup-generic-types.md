With the release of Vue 3.3, an exciting feature is now at the disposal of developers: Generic
Components. This new feature makes it possible to define reusable components that can handle
different data types. It's a tremendous step forward in increasing the modularity of Vue
applications.

### The Magic of Generic Props

Previously, you had to explicitly opt-in to use this feature. Now, it's enabled by default in the
latest versions of Vue Language Features (Volar) and TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar). Do note that you
need to update these plugins to versions later than 1.6 to avoid potential errors like
`T is not defined within script setup`.

So, how does it work? Let's explore this feature:

In Vue 3.3, you can define props that accept different types of values. It's done through the
`<script setup>` tag with the `generic` attribute. Here is a quick example:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts" generic="T">
defineProps<{
  items: T[]
  selected: T
}>()
</script>
```

The value of `generic` works exactly like the parameter list in TypeScript (the part between
`<...>`). You can use multiple parameters, extend constraints, use default types, and even reference
imported types:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts" generic="T extends string | number, U extends Item">
import type { Item } from './types'
defineProps<{
  id: T
  list: U[]
}>()
</script>
```

### Making Components More Reusable

Given this new capability, you can now make your components reusable for different types of data.
Let's illustrate this using a `SwiperComponent` as an example:

1. Define your `SwiperComponent` with a generic prop:

```vue
<!-- SwiperComponent.vue -->
<template>
  <swiper class="w-full h-full">
    <swiper-slide
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="index"
    >
      <!-- Expose the item data to the default slot -->
      <slot :item="item"></slot>
    </swiper-slide>
  </swiper>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts" generic="T">
import { defineProps } from 'vue'

defineProps<{
  items: T[]
}>()
</script>
```

2. Use your `SwiperComponent` with a specific type:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <SwiperComponent :items="testimonials">
    <template #default="{ item }: { item: Testimonial }">
      <!-- Display your data -->
    </template>
  </SwiperComponent>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
interface Testimonial {
  // Your data structure
}

const testimonials = [
  // Your testimonials data
] as Testimonial[]
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Your styles */
</style>
```

In the example above, `SwiperComponent` is now a generic component that can accept any type of items
as long as they are in an array. Then, when using `SwiperComponent`, you can specify the type of the
item in the slot.

This way, you can reuse `SwiperComponent` with different types of data. Each time you use it, just
specify the type of the data when you use the slot.

This new feature brings more flexibility and power to Vue applications, allowing developers to write
cleaner, more maintainable, and modular code. Happy coding with Vue 3.3 and generics!
