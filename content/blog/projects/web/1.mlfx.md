  MLFX was the first big project I completed on my own, I did all the frontend and most of the
  backend work. It was a huge learning curve for me and helped me to improve in all areas.

### TL;DR

MLFX (Machine Learning Forex) is a Single Page Application (SPA) SaaS web application built using
Vue3, Typescript, Node and Postgres.

MLFX uses a **proprietary machine learning algorithm** to provide Forex signals to users for a
monthly subscription. Users can take trades in a simulated environment, monitor their performance
over time, learn from other traders and once profitable switch to live-trading.

This app, outside of the algorithm, was was created from idea to end by me, it's the first project
that helped me to solidify all my business and development knowledge. Although the business is on
hold for now, I still work on it in my free time.

### App Stack

- **JS Framework:** Vue 2 (Single Page Application) - This will be migrated to vue 3 or Nuxt 3
  shortly
- **Hosting:** Digital Ocean hosting
  - **Algorithm:** Scalable Droplet
  - **Website:** Nginx Server Block (split with some open source services to save $)
  - **App:** Static hosting
- **Auth:** Auth0
- **Database:** Postgres
- **API:** Rest/Graphql
- **Forex Data Provider:** Oanda
<!-- **:** Rest/Graphql -->

![MLFX Trades Page](/projects/mlfx/trades.png)

### During the development of MLFX I had to complete the following:

- **Auth0** Authentication/Authorization
- **Stripe** for Subscriptions/Payments
- **Apollo Client GraphQL** API Development
- **PostgreSQL** Database Design/Implementation
- **Node js** backend for secure API calls **using JWT**
- Designing the app & UI/UX
- Writing copy & articles
- Recording/Editing marketing videos
- Charting real-time data
- Manipulating data with SQL queries and functions
- Optimizing for SEO/Performance

### I also experimented with a bunch of tools that are no longer part of the stack:

- **Hasura** for graphQL API, Business logic and Database CRUD - This was costing quite a bit, $99
  USD per month while we had no customers.
- **Vuex:** For state management, I ended up switching to Pinia as it's a cleaner architecture

### Some simple code examples

This gives you an idea how I think and the type of problems I was solving while working on MLFX.
It's worth noting that I've impoved a LOT since writing this code!

##### A PIP is a simple movement measurement in trading, I needed to convert raw price data into PIP values to display to our users.

```javascript
export default function toPIPs(instrument, quantity) {
  const x100 =
    instrument.search(/JPY/) >= 0 ||
    instrument.search(/HUF/) >= 0 ||
    instrument.search(/KRW/) >= 0 ||
    instrument.search(/THB/) >= 0
  if (x100) {
    // PIP = 0.01
    return (quantity * 100).toFixed(1)
  }

  const x1000 =
    instrument.search(/CZK/) >= 0 || instrument.search(/CNY/) >= 0 || instrument.search(/INR/) >= 0
  if (x1000) {
    // PIP = 0.001
    return (quantity * 1000).toFixed(1)
  }

  // Default PIP = 0.0001
  return (quantity * 10000).toFixed(1)
}
```

##### I needed to processing each rate before sending it to our charts. Thankfully we had control over the incoming data, so I knew what format it would be in.

```javascript
const newRate = (r) => {
  // make timezone dynamic
  const localDate = new Date()
  // have to convert the server time to local time before comparing
  const timeOffset = localDate.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000
  const open = (r.open_bid + r.open_ask) / 2
  const close = (r.close_bid + r.close_ask) / 2
  const rateTime = r.time - timeOffset
  return [
    rateTime,
    Number(open.toFixed(5)),
    Number(r.high_ask.toFixed(5)),
    Number(r.low_bid.toFixed(5)),
    Number(close.toFixed(5)),
    r.volume
  ]
}
```

Looking at this code with my current abilities, I want to rewrite it in TypeScript to validate the
incoming data. It would also benefit from being more dynamic since we will likely have multiple data
inputs in the future.

I also completed a re-write of the MLFX code before my business partner and I decided to go seperate ways.

Some of what I did included:

1. Update JS to TypeScript
2. Upgrade from Vue 2 to Nuxt3
3. Mobile first redesign
4. Zod for data validation
5. Partytown to separate blocking JS and speed up initial page load
6. Vuex to Pinia for state management
7. SCSS to TailwindCSS for styling
