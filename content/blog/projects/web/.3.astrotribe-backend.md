## TL;DR

I was approached for advice on building this social network and decided to take on the part-time
role of CTO.

There was no existing plan, so I had to start from scratch. This involved conversations with the
founder to uncover exactly what they wanted the app to do and roughly how it should look. My
development process looked something like this:

1. Talk to the founder, find out what data would be displayed in the app and how users/admins would
   be able to interact with it
2. Completed market research to see if there's competittion and if so, what they are doing well
3. Compile a list of functionality orderd by importance
4. Confirm functionality with team
5. Complete system design for app
6. Design database
7. Setup backend servers
8. Connect to frontend & start development

As I write this I'm working on step 7.

## The project scope

This will be an ongoing project for me, as the CEO an I, Shweta, are close. She has little IT
experience so I'm working as a consultant/CTO until we can find someone suitable to take over. In
the meantime I'm putting together a MVP for what she's called Astrotribe, a global network for
astronomers and stargazers.

The project will help to bring astronomers together across the globe, train the next generationg,
and provide financial oportunities in the field for underserviced communities. Astronomy has always
been facinating to me, which is why I decided to join the team.

### Getting started

After talking to the founder and grilling her for details about the project, we painted a vivid
picture of Astrotribe. Clarity is important to me, it ensures that I deliver on what I say, and
their can be no arguments because we both agreed on it. That's not to say the plan won't change, but
a clear direction is important!

With all these details fresh in my mind I turned to my old pal Google and asked him/her the same
questions I'd been asking Shweta. Market research is a vital step for me if I'm serious about the
project. I don't care if someone else has already done it, I need to know what is out their and have
a clear picture of the competittion. Luckily for us, I found only a few competitors.

### Define the MVP

While condcuting market research I'll list out all the features that look interesting. From there I
can easily create a document containing what I would consider our MVP (including Shweta's initial
thoughts). This document is aproved by the team before I get started with any development work.

## Create our software on paper

Compared to a simple sketch software development takes eons! I don't like wasting time, or being
made to delete hundreds of lines of code, it's wasteful! Instead I opt to create a system mockup
with all the different moving parts. Then I can spend some time researching and making sure all
these parts play nice together, especially if I'm not familiar with a specific part.

Before signing this as complete I like to also think 'What would our design look like with 100k
users? What about 1 million users?' If the system will look far different at each stage, then it's
time to start your design again! Some change is acceptable, but you want to start with a strong
foundation.

## Database design

Now that I had decided to use Postgres it was time to create the database. I added more than needed
for the MVP, this will help me to think big when I am writing all the frontend/backend code. if I
can write 20 extra lines of code now and save days of pain in 6 months, it's worth the tradeoff.

## Setup all backend

### Setup all backend

<!--
```javascript
function findOddInt(input) {
  const count = {}
  // cycle through input integers
  for (const element of input)
  {
    // if integer exists add 1 to count
    if (count[element]) count[element] += 1
    // add first count if it does not exist
    else count[element] = 1
  }

  // cycle through tallied integers
  Object.keys(count).forEach(key =>
  {
    // return integer if count is odd
    if ((count[key] % 2) !== 0) return Number(key)
  })

  // return null if no odd count found
  return null
}
